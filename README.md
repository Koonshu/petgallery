Displays pictures of animals with the possibility of filtering them
Project developed for a job interview with Insider Guides

This page was developed without the use of any frameworks or libraries. It's just HTML / CSS / Javascript.

I added an option to reset the filters, to display all the pictures again. When a filter is selected, a cross is displayed next to the caret.

The page is working well on any screen size. The number of columns varies according to the screen size (up to 3 columns).
